This repository contains a collection of projects centered around RISC-V architecture. Each project explores different aspects of the RISC-V instruction set, focusing on system-level programming, hardware-software interaction, and low-level optimization. The projects are designed to highlight the capabilities and versatility of RISC-V, from basic instruction-level operations to more complex system implementations.
