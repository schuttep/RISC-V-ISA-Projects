Skyline Screen Saver

This project is a Skyline Screen Saver implemented in C and RISC-V assembly, which renders a dynamic city skyline animation featuring stars, windows, and beacons. The skyline is drawn and updated based on various graphical elements, and the program utilizes low-level RISC-V assembly for performance-critical functions.

Features
City Skyline Rendering: Draws a dynamic city skyline with varying heights and colors.
Animated Stars: Stars appear and twinkle randomly across the sky.
Illuminated Windows: Randomly lights up windows in buildings to simulate nighttime city life.
Beacon Control: A beacon shines intermittently from a building, controlled by external functions.
Efficient Rendering: Critical functions are implemented in RISC-V assembly for optimized performance.
